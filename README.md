This repository is a public record of how I think, solve problems, and use AI to help in those processes.

### How I Work
I work in AI/ML system design. I use LLMs aggressively as collaborators, but I treat them with skepticism. I don't use AI to "generate content"; I use it to stress-test ideas, explore failure modes, and accelerate the path to a workable solution.

I prioritize **Radical Simplicity**. If a solution is more complex than the problem it’s solving, I consider it a failure.

### Why This Repo Exists
If you are evaluating me for a role, this space should answer three questions:
1. Can I frame a problem clearly?
2. Do I know when to stop trusting my tools?
3. Am I comfortable killing my own ideas?

You won't find grand "visions" or complex frameworks here. You will find notes on what I’ve built, what I’ve broken, and—most importantly—what I’ve decided to throw away.
