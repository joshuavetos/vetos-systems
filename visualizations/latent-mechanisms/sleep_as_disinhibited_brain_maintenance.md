# Sleep as Disinhibited Brain Maintenance: A Mechanistic View

This visualization depicts sleep not as an active trigger of brain repair, but as a **disinhibited maintenance state** caused by the withdrawal of wake-associated suppression.

The figure is organized into four mechanistic panels:

**Panel 1 – Wakefulness (Norepinephrine Brake):**  
During wakefulness, norepinephrine released from the locus coeruleus suppresses microglial process motility via β2-adrenergic signaling. Microglia are functionally immobilized, synaptic debris and micro-damage accumulate, and repair is actively prevented rather than absent.

**Panel 2 – Sleep Onset (Disinhibition):**  
Sleep onset is represented as a reduction in norepinephrine signaling. The removal of this inhibitory brake allows intrinsic microglial motility and repair processes to resume. Sleep is shown as the *removal of suppression*, not the addition of an activating signal.

**Panel 3 – Sleep Maintenance (Parallel Processes):**  
Three processes occur simultaneously during sustained sleep:
- Microglial synaptic pruning and debris clearance  
- Glymphatic clearance via cerebrospinal fluid flow, removing amyloid-β, tau, and metabolic waste  
- Synaptic homeostasis, including global downscaling of weak synapses and selective strengthening via memory replay  

These processes are shown in parallel to avoid false sequential causality.

**Panel 4 – Failure and Attrition Pathways:**  
The visualization explicitly includes dominant failure modes:
- Acute sleep deprivation (~12 hours) produces transient neural progenitor proliferation (Ki-67+), followed by >90% attrition before survival.  
- Chronic sleep deprivation (weeks to years) leads to persistent microglial suppression, glymphatic failure, waste accumulation, and a >50% collapse in neurogenesis survival, contributing to long-term neurodegenerative drift.

The visualization intentionally emphasizes suppression, attrition, uncertainty, and timescale separation to avoid the common textbook error of depicting sleep as a uniformly beneficial or deterministic repair process.
