## Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis — Systems‑Level Visualization

This figure presents a unified, multi‑layer systems‑biology model of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus subgranular zone (SGZ). Unlike traditional stage‑based cartoons, this visualization integrates spatial anatomy, lineage progression, regulatory signaling, temporal dynamics, uncertainty encoding, and functional output into a single coherent framework.

### **1. Spatial Anatomy (Bottom Layer)**
The base layer depicts an anatomically grounded cross‑section of the SGZ, including:
- granule cell layer and hilus
- local vasculature
- astrocytic processes
- microglial cells
- GABAergic interneuron terminals
- extracellular matrix components

This establishes the physical niche in which neurogenesis occurs.

### **2. Lineage Flow (Central Ribbon)**
A continuous left‑to‑right ribbon represents the full developmental trajectory:
- quiescent Type‑1 radial glia‑like stem cells  
- activated Type‑1 stem cells  
- Type‑2a intermediate progenitors  
- Type‑2b intermediate progenitors  
- Type‑3 migratory neuroblasts  
- immature granule neurons  
- mature integrated granule neurons  

Ribbon thickness encodes transition probability, and opacity reflects confidence in the underlying evidence. Branches represent apoptosis, failed integration, and return to quiescence.

### **3. Regulatory Network (Overlaid Signals)**
Key modulatory influences are mapped directly onto the lineage stages they affect:
- microglial cytokines (IL‑1β, TNF‑α)  
- astrocytic support signals (Wnt, Shh)  
- vascular niche factors (VEGF, BDNF)  
- GABAergic interneuron activity  
- glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex  

Arrow color, thickness, and transparency encode signal type, strength, and certainty.

### **4. System Parameters (Quantitative Indicators)**
Four dynamic parameters are displayed as horizontal bars aligned with the developmental timeline:
- proliferation rate  
- apoptosis probability  
- integration success rate  
- activity‑dependent modulation strength  

Each parameter varies across stages, emphasizing the non‑uniform nature of neurogenesis.

### **5. Functional Output (Top Layer)**
The final stage of the lineage connects to three cognitive functions associated with successful integration of new granule neurons:
- pattern separation  
- memory encoding  
- stress buffering  

These outputs highlight the behavioral relevance of the cellular process.

### **6. Multi‑Scale Insets**
Three inset panels provide mechanistic detail at the subcellular level:
- transcriptional programs (NeuroD1, Prox1, DCX)  
- dendritic spine maturation (filopodia → thin → mushroom)  
- axon growth cone navigation cues (netrin, semaphorin, ephrin)  

Each inset is linked to the specific lineage stage it governs.

### **7. Uncertainty Encoding**
Debated or low‑confidence steps are represented with semi‑transparent overlays and ghosted alternative pathways. This explicitly distinguishes well‑established mechanisms from areas of active scientific debate.

This visualization functions as a comprehensive systems‑level map of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, integrating structure, mechanism, regulation, probability, and function into a single, publication‑grade figure.
