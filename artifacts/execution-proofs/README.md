Real execution receipts.

These files are generated from clean-room runs on fresh Linux environments (WSL Ubuntu).

Each proof captures:
- Kernel fingerprint
- Python runtime version
- Dependency surface
- Pytest output

They are intentionally raw and timestamped.

Purpose: demonstrate that the repository executes deterministically outside the author’s machine.

No synthetic runs are included.
