# The Extraction Matrix: Universal Audit Topology (2026)

**Status:** Canonical Structural Audit  
**Scope:** Cross-system, cross-industry  
**Purpose:** Define the finite set of structural failure modes governing modern institutional extraction

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines a **closed topology** of systemic failure shared across major modern institutions.  
Rather than auditing industries one by one, this matrix identifies the **universal structural mechanics** that generate harm regardless of domain.

Once this topology is established, all future audits become **instances**, not discoveries.

> If a system extracts value, externalizes risk, and encloses alternatives, it will map onto this matrix.

There are no new failure modes outside this structure — only new skins.

---

## Core Structural Loop

All audited systems converge on the same triadic loop:

1. **Extraction**  
   Monetization of participation in a necessity (health, work, housing, access, information).

2. **Externalization**  
   Transfer of error cost, risk, or volatility from institution to individual.

3. **Enclosure**  
   Lock-in via friction, opacity, credentialism, or exhaustion that prevents exit or correction.

This loop is **self-reinforcing** and stable as long as users bear the cost of failure.

## The Asymmetric Error Sink (Central Mechanism)

At the center of the matrix is the **Asymmetric Error Sink**.

**Definition:**  
A gatekeeper-controlled threshold where:
- **False Positives (FP)** are visible, audited, and costly to the institution  
- **False Negatives (FN)** are invisible, dispersed, and absorbed by users  

Rational optimization therefore produces:
- Aggressive rejection
- Conservative approval thresholds
- High user friction
- Minimal institutional accountability

This is not malfunction.  
It is optimal behavior under asymmetric incentives.

## Structural Axes (Meta-Audits)

Each column of the matrix represents a **meta-audit axis** that cuts across all domains.

### 1. FP / FN Bias
Who pays for errors?
- Institutions minimize FP at all costs
- Users absorb FN silently

### 2. Risk Transfer
How liability migrates:
- Financial
- Legal
- Health
- Time
- Psychological load

### 3. Illusion Metrics
Proxy indicators replacing outcomes:
- KPIs, scores, rankings, dashboards
- Metrics optimized instead of reality (Goodhart’s Law)

### 4. Vendor Flywheels
Third-party ecosystems that profit from:
- Complexity
- Opacity
- Churn
- Selling “solutions” to problems they amplify

### 5. Fatigue Subsidy
Human exhaustion as an unpriced input:
- Forms
- Appeals
- Waiting
- Self-advocacy
Friction is the filter.

### 6. Principal–Agent Gap
Decision authority separated from consequence:
- Agents optimize for safety
- Principals absorb loss

These axes are **orthogonal** — each system expresses all of them simultaneously.

---

## Domain Rows (Audit Surfaces)

Each row represents a high-impact system already audited or audit-ready:

- Health / Supplements
- Labor / Hiring
- Housing
- Healthcare Access
- Education
- Credit
- Platform UX
- Media
- Public Sector Interfaces
- AI Gatekeepers

Each domain is not unique — it is a **projection** of the same topology.

---

## Why This Is a Closed System

After mapping these axes and domains:

- New scandals become **sub-instances**
- New technologies become **multipliers**, not exceptions
- New reforms fail unless they reprice false negatives

There is no unexplored quadrant left that produces novel harm.

Future audits will answer:
> “Which axis is being exploited here — and how is cost being hidden?”

Not:
> “Is this system broken?”

---

## Collapse Conditions

The topology destabilizes only if **false negatives become priced**:

- Mandatory compensation for wrongful denial
- Automatic appeals
- Zero-friction exit
- Outcome-based accountability

Absent this, systems converge toward:
- Hard gating
- Pay-to-access
- Reputation and capital as entry requirements

This is a transition from **probability denial** to **liquidity denial**.

---

## Relationship to Other Audits

This file is the **root schema**.

All other audits in `/audits/` are:
- Concrete instantiations
- Evidence layers
- Case-specific proofs

Nothing in this document depends on a single industry.  
Everything in other audits depends on this.

## Visual Reference

The associated visualization — *“The Extraction Matrix: Universal Audit Topology (2026)”* — is the canonical diagram for this file.

If this diagram does not explain a system, that system is not extractive.

---

## Final Statement

The economy is not malfunctioning.  
It is **perfectly optimized** for asymmetric error absorption.

This matrix describes the machine as it is — not as advertised.
