# Asymmetric Gatekeeper Error Transfer
**Q1 2026 — Cross-System Structural Audit**

## Executive Summary
Across modern institutional systems, a shared failure mode recurs:  
**gatekeepers optimize to minimize their own downside by tolerating extremely high false-negative (FN) rates, while externalizing FN costs onto users.**  
False positives (FPs) are treated as catastrophic for the institution; false negatives are invisible, diffuse, and unpaid.  
The result is systemic over-rejection, friction, and user harm that appears accidental but is structurally rational.

This audit documents the pattern across supplements, hiring, insurance, credit, subscriptions, housing, and welfare.

## Core Failure Mode
**Asymmetric error cost absorption in a principal–agent gate**

- **Gatekeeper (Agent)** controls approval or access
- **User (Principal)** bears the cost of denial
- **Incentive**: avoid visible FP costs at all costs
- **Outcome**: tolerate massive FN rates

This is not dysfunction. It is optimization under asymmetric accountability.

## Comparative Error Pattern

| System | Gate | Gatekeeper | FN Cost Absorber | FP Visibility | FN Visibility |
|------|------|------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Supplements | Efficacy claims | Manufacturers | Consumers | High (recalls) | Low (wasted money) |
| Hiring | ATS + screening | HR / Vendors | Candidates | Medium (bad hire) | Near zero |
| Insurance | Prior auth | Insurers / PBMs | Patients | Medium | High but delayed |
| Credit | Scoring thresholds | Lenders / Bureaus | Borrowers | High | Medium |
| Subscriptions | Cancellation UX | Platforms | Users | Near zero | Low |
| Welfare | Eligibility rules | Agencies | Applicants | High (fraud optics) | Low |

Institutions minimize FP <5% by accepting FN rates of 20–90%.

---

## Risk Externalization Pattern
Risk systematically migrates **downstream**:

- Institutions retain **optionality**
- Users absorb **time, money, health, and psychological cost**
- No feedback loop prices FN harm back into the system

“No outcome” is profitable.

## Illusion Metrics vs Reality Metrics

| System | Illusion Metric | Reality Metric |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Supplements | Before/after photos | Long-term efficacy |
| Hiring | Job postings | Actual offers |
| Insurance | Approval rate | Appeal overturn rate |
| Credit | Score badges | Denial rates |
| Subscriptions | Retention | Failed cancellations |

Illusions persist long enough to extract value before reality appears.

---

## Vendor Amplification
Entire vendor ecosystems monetize this asymmetry:

- ATS vendors profit from rejection volume
- PBMs profit from denial delay
- Billing platforms profit from cancellation friction
- Credit bureaus profit from opacity

Efficiency would collapse their revenue models.

---

## Stability Mechanism: The Fatigue Subsidy
The system relies on **human exhaustion**.

- Appeals, retries, and exits require time and executive function
- Most users abandon valid claims
- Gatekeepers treat abandonment as signal

If friction vanished, valid demand would overwhelm the gate.

---

## Agentic Inflection Point
User-side automation (AI agents) eliminates fatigue.

When appeals, applications, and disputes scale to zero marginal cost:
- Soft friction fails
- Systems shift to **hard gating** (fees, identity, wealth signals)

Prediction:  
**Probability denial → liquidity denial**

Access will increasingly require upfront capital, reputation, or payment.

---

## Conclusion
These systems are not broken.  
They are **fully optimized** to externalize error costs while internalizing yield.

The shared pattern is structural, convergent, and intentional by incentive —  
even when no individual actor is malicious.

This audit documents the mechanism.
