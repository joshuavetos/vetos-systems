Dear Mr. Lacock,

Please accept this correspondence as a formal public comment regarding the Shape Sioux Falls 2050 Comprehensive Development Plan (Draft dated December 22, 2025), submitted in advance of its final adoption.

Upon review of the draft, I have identified several internal capacity and funding gaps where stated objectives rely on infrastructure availability that the plan acknowledges as currently unresolved. The following points outline specific areas where the draft plan and the City’s published 2026–2030 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) do not align:

  - Phased Growth and Funding: While the plan outlines a tier system for service availability (pp. 53–54), it acknowledges that Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas require additional monetary resources that are not yet identified or scheduled (pp. 54, 58).
  - Infrastructure Alignment: The plan notes that growth areas are determined by infrastructure availability (p. 58), yet it admits to the potential for premature identification of these areas without full infrastructure review or programmed extensions.
  - Housing Demand: Although the plan prioritizes infill and housing density (pp. 25, 100–101), there is no quantified mitigation strategy identified to address the current housing cost burden or the documented supply shortfall (pp. 18, 20).
  - CIP Integration: The draft plan assumes alignment with the Capital Improvement Program for tiered growth. However, the adopted 2026–2030 CIP ($1.035 billion) does not reference the Tier 1, 2, or 3 growth areas, nor does it include specific funding allocations tied to those tiers.

Procedural Request for the Record
I respectfully request clarification on how these capacity and funding gaps—specifically regarding pages 7, 18, 20, 54, and 58 of the draft and their cross-reference with the 2026–2030 CIP—will be resolved or funded within the final Shape Sioux Falls 2050 Plan prior to its adoption.

Thank you for including these comments in the official public record.

Sincerely,

Josh Vetos

Josh,

Thank you for your email comments. Sorry for the delay in response. We will include your email as an attachment as we move toward adoption.

The purpose of a Comprehensive Plan is to provide a vision for the future of Sioux Falls and identify the steps that would be needed to achieve that vision. We’re looking out 25 years and as you know, the CIP does not go beyond 5 years. But the point of the document is to help elected and appointed officials make decisions when it comes to land use based on how Sioux Falls has historically grown and projecting that 25 years into the future. The Tier Maps identify generally where and when public infrastructure will be available for development. This is a great tool to help prevent premature development and also provides parity to the developing public. The Tier Maps and growth strategy for Sioux Falls depends on close coordination of the CIP for all public utilities and facilities. This includes where fire stations should be constructed and strategies for combining schools, parks, and libraries in close proximity. The Tier Maps do generally follow the predicted budget model for each departments facility needs. One of the benefits of the way Sioux Falls plans, is that we update the Tier Maps every year. After the adoption of the Shape Sioux Falls 2050 Comprehensive Plan, we will be bringing forward a Tier Map amendment before the end of the year. This is also not a static document, but a living plan that can and will be amended as Sioux Falls grows, and priorities continue to evolve.

Thanks!


Dear Mr. Lacock,

Thank you for the clarification and for including my comments in the official record. I appreciate the explanation regarding the long-range nature of the plan and the annual Tier Map update process.

My intent was to note that certain growth assumptions remain contingent on future funding, CIP coordination, and subsequent amendments, rather than being fully resolved at the time of adoption. I appreciate the confirmation of how this will be managed moving forward.

Thank you again for your response.

Best regards,

Josh Vetos
