# Audits — Structural Systems

This folder contains empirical audits of institutional systems where outcomes systematically diverge from stated goals.

Across domains, the same invariant recurs:

Institutions optimize to minimize visible false positives (approving a bad case) while tolerating unlimited invisible false negatives (rejecting good cases), because downside risk is externalized and upside is retained.

Each audit in this folder documents a concrete instantiation of that invariant using primary sources, bounded claims, and reproducible logic.

These are not opinions.
They are pattern confirmations.
