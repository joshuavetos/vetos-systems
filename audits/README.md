# Audits — Structural Systems

This folder contains structural audits of institutional systems where
observed outcomes reliably diverge from stated intent.

Across domains, the same invariant appears:

Systems are optimized to minimize visible false positives
(approving a bad case) while tolerating unbounded false negatives
(rejecting valid cases), because rejection risk is externalized
and approval risk is internalized.

Each audit documents a specific instantiation of this invariant,
grounded in primary artifacts, explicit constraints,
and reproducible reasoning.

These files are not critiques or opinions.
They are pattern confirmations of a shared system grammar.
