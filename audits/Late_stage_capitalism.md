# Late-Stage Capitalism: Structural Systems Audit  
**Joshua Scott Vetos | Feb 2026 | Audit Artifact**

---

## Scope & Classification

**Artifact Type:** Structural Systems Audit (Macro-Economic / Institutional)  
**Method:** Mechanism-first analysis with source-anchored aggregates and median deltas  
**Population:** U.S. median households (non-top-decile), 1980–2026  
**Purpose:** Identify how aggregate growth converts into median stagnation via invariant system design

This document is **not** a white paper, opinion essay, or journalism.  
It is an audit of **flows, incentives, and risk allocation** across large economic systems.

---

## 1. Core Finding (Executive Summary)

U.S. productivity gains since ~1980 have exceeded median wage growth by **2.7–3×**, while essential costs (housing, healthcare, education) have risen **3–5× faster than wages**. The gap is not accidental. It is produced and sustained by structural mechanisms that:

- Route new money to asset owners first  
- Convert ownership into recurring rent (OpEx)  
- Optimize institutions to avoid visible false positives at the cost of massive false negatives  
- Socialize institutional failure while privatizing individual failure  

The economy is not malfunctioning. It is **operating as designed**.

## 2. Aggregate vs Median Divergence (1980–2026)

### Inflation-Adjusted Cumulative Growth (1980 baseline)

| Metric | Growth | Annualized | Notes |
|------|-------|------------|------|
| Productivity (nonfarm) | +90% | ~1.6% | Aggregate output/hour |
| Median hourly wage | +29–33% | ~0.6% | 50th percentile worker |
| Median household income | +25–30% | ~0.5–0.6% | CPS ASEC |
| Housing prices | +200–250% | 3.0–3.5% | Case-Shiller/FHFA |
| Healthcare premiums | +400–500% | 4.5–5.0% | KFF |
| Public college tuition | +300–400% | 3.8–4.5% | College Board |
| Discretionary income | –10% to 0% | ~0% | After essentials |

**Result:** Aggregate growth decouples from median access.  
**Gap by 2026:** ~60%+ unrealized median wage potential.

## 3. Risk Allocation Matrix (2026 Snapshot)

| Sector | Price Volatility | Income Volatility | Liability | Failure Cost |
|------|------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| Housing | Individual | Individual | Lender / Insurer | Individual |
| Employment | Firm (wage suppression) | Individual | Firm / Gov | Individual |
| Healthcare | Individual | Individual | Insurer / Gov | Individual |
| Education | Individual | Individual | Gov / Servicer | Individual |
| Consumer Finance | Individual | Individual | Lender | Individual |

**Summary:**  
~70–80% of downside risk borne by individuals.  
Upside captured by firms, asset holders, and intermediaries.

## 4. Structural Transmission Mechanisms

### 4.1 Cantillon Effect (Money Entry Point)

- Monetary expansion enters via banks, capital markets, and large institutions.
- First recipients bid up assets (housing, equities, M&A).
- Wages receive diluted money last, if at all.

**Explains:**  
Housing +200% vs wages +30%.

---

### 4.2 The OpEx Trap (Ownership → Usership)

- Shift from CapEx (owning) to OpEx (renting, subscriptions).
- Firms gain predictable cash flow and higher valuation multiples.
- Households face permanent fixed costs with no equity buffer.

**Outcome:**  
Discretionary income stagnates despite nominal growth.

---

### 4.3 Efficiency Buffer Collapse

- Lean staffing, just-in-time supply, zero slack.
- All resilience removed to maximize short-term margins.
- Shocks transmit instantly to consumers via prices or service denial.

**Outcome:**  
Corporate earnings rise while service quality stagnates or declines.

---

### 4.4 Goodhart’s Law (Metric Gaming)

- **Unemployment:** Reclassified via gig work, discouraged workers.  
- **Inflation (CPI):** Substitution bias lowers reported inflation while reducing living standards.

**Outcome:**  
Indicators signal “health” while lived conditions degrade.

---

## 5. False-Negative Optimization (Cross-System Pattern)

Institutions minimize **false positives** (visible failures) and tolerate extreme **false negatives** (invisible rejections).

| System | False Positive Cost | False Negative Cost | Preference |
|------|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Hiring | Visible (bad hire) | Invisible (lost talent) | Reject |
| Lending | Audited default | Denied credit | Deny |
| Insurance | Claims loss | Coverage denial | Exclude |
| Welfare | Fraud optics | Eligible denial | Deny |

**Result:**  
Systems select for *“not obviously bad”*, not *“actually good”*.

---

## 6. Financialization (Operational Definition)

Financialization =  
- Assetization of operational flows  
- Yield extraction over reinvestment  
- Rent models over one-time sales  

Post-1980, non-financial firms increase financial assets faster than real investment.

**Effect:**  
Cost ↑, quality ↔, access ↓

---

## 7. Appearance vs Reality Metrics (2019–2026)

| Appearance | Reality | Divergence |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Job postings +14% | Actual offers –33% | Ghost jobs |
| GDP +15–20% | Median wages +3–6% | Decoupling |
| Corporate earnings +80% | Service quality flat | Buffer removal |
| UX convenience ↑ | Affordability ↓ | Cost externalization |

---

## 8. Systemic Summary Table

| Component | Institutional State | Median Household State | Transfer Mechanism |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Capital Access | Cheap, first access | Expensive, last access | Cantillon |
| Asset Control | Aggregation | Renting | OpEx trap |
| Volatility | Hedged | Exposed | Efficiency collapse |
| Failure | Socialized | Privatized | Asymmetric backstop |

---

## 9. Conclusion

The economy is not broken.  
It is **fully optimized** to:

- Internalize yield  
- Externalize volatility  
- Preserve institutional legitimacy  
- Obscure median losses with aggregate metrics  

The divergence between productivity and lived outcomes is not a bug.  
It is a **design feature**.

## Status

**Audit State:** COMPLETE  
**Revision Class:** Structural  
**Downstream Use:** Root-cause reference for sector audits (housing, hiring, healthcare, education)
