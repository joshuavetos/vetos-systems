# Supplement Illusion: A Quantitative Audit of Fitness Influencer Claims  
**Joshua Scott Vetos | February 2026**  
**Technical White Paper / Preprint**

---

## Abstract
Fitness influencer supplement claims routinely violate established physiological rate limits. Across resistance-trained adults (20–40y, compliant protocols), core training variables—sleep, weekly volume, proximity to failure—outperform supplements by factors of **3–20×**. Widely circulated “transformations” are predominantly **appearance deltas achievable in <1 hour**, not tissue-level change. Economic incentives reliably predict claim inflation, while long-term connective tissue and metabolic risks are externalized. This paper consolidates rate limits, effect sizes, incentive structures, and visual forensics into a single audit framework, bounded to current physiology literature.

**Population bounds:** resistance-trained adults, 20–40y, no endocrine pathology, compliant training and nutrition.  
**Evidence hierarchy:** Meta-analyses prioritized; journalism demoted to context only.

## 1. Physiological Rate Limits (Hard Ceilings)
Established ceilings constrain what supplements can plausibly achieve.

| Process | Upper Bound | Anchor |
|---|---:|---|
| Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) | ~0.04–0.05%/day | Damas et al., JISSN (meta) |
| Fat oxidation | ~0.5 g/min (max exercise) | ACSM Position Stand |
| Cartilage turnover | <1%/year | OA systematic reviews |
| Testosterone elevation | HPG axis saturation; SHBG limits free T | Endocrine reviews |
| ATP production | VO₂max constrained | Exercise physiology reviews |

**Implication:** Claims such as “10 lb muscle in 30 days” are biologically impossible under non-pharmacologic conditions.

---

## 2. Claim Audit (What Supplements Actually Do)
Effect sizes are normalized to trained adults.

| Claim | Realistic Effect |
|---|---|
| Fat burners “overnight” | ~50 kcal/day additional expenditure |
| “Double testosterone” | <15% transient rise in deficient states |
| “10 lb/month anabolic stacks” | ~0.5–1 lb/month (trained) |
| DOMS elimination | ~10–20% soreness reduction |
| **Creatine monohydrate** | **Supported:** ~2–4 lb water; ~1–2 lb lean mass over 12 weeks |

---

## 3. Appearance vs. Biology (The <1-Hour Transformation)
Large visual changes do not imply tissue change.

**Ranked appearance manipulators (acute):**
1. **Lighting** (20–40% apparent leanness)
2. **Pump** (20–50% transient muscle volume)
3. **Dehydration** (10–15% definition)
4. **Camera angle / sodium / glycogen**

**Summary:** **50–100% visual change** can be produced acutely; equivalent body-composition change requires **8–16 weeks**.

---

## 4. The Dehydration Paradox (Structural Contradiction)
Influencers frequently induce **acute dehydration** to enhance appearance while simultaneously marketing supplements purported to improve “recovery,” “joint health,” or “hormones.” Chronic repetition of these protocols (3–5% body-weight water loss) is associated with **tendon stiffness, reduced joint lubrication, and elevated osteoarthritis markers** in athlete cohorts over time.  
**Conclusion:** The industry often **creates the downstream risks it claims to solve**, without alleging intent or deception.

---

## 5. Causality via Claim Evolution (Quasi-Experimental Evidence)
Across platforms, **claim language shifts with sponsorship** while physique remains constant.  
**Design logic:**  
- **Control:** the influencer (same genetics, training, body composition)  
- **Intervention:** sponsor/product change  
- **Outcome:** claim language and promised mechanisms  

Observed pattern: thermogenic → “hormonal” → “mitochondrial” claims rotate with sponsors. This provides **quasi-experimental evidence** that incentives, not physiology, drive claims.

---

## 6. Incentive Structure (Non-Moralized)
Revenue channels predict behavior without implying intent.

| Revenue Source | Typical Claim |
|---|---|
| Affiliates (10–30%) | “Life-changing fat burner” |
| Brand deals ($500–$50k/post) | “Science-backed booster” |
| Private label (50–70% margin) | “My proprietary stack” |
| Courses/coaching | “Exact protocol required” |

---

## 7. Effect Size Ratios (Training vs. Supplements)
Training variables dominate outcomes.

| Supplement | :Sleep | :Weekly Volume | :Proximity to Failure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Creatine | 1:8–12 | 1:6–10 | 1:4–6 |
| Caffeine | 1:6–10 | 1:5–8 | 1:3–5 |
| EAAs | 1:10–15 | 1:8–12 | 1:5–8 |

## 8. Case Study Autopsy (Worked Example)
**Viral “30-Day Transformation” (genericized):**  
1. **Claim:** “30 days, new physique—fat burner + test booster.”  
2. **Visual forensics:** 15° downward lighting shift, post-workout pump, **48-hour dehydration**, low-angle camera.  
3. **Supplement plausibility:** Thermogenic stack → **~50 kcal/day**; herbal T booster → **no meaningful anabolic effect**.  
4. **Revenue:** ~$47 affiliate revenue per conversion (public rates).

**Plausible tissue change (30 days):**  
- Muscle: **<0.5 lb**  
- Fat: **~1 lb** (deficit-dependent)

**Appearance delta:** ~40% attributable to acute manipulations.  
**Finding:** This pattern recurs across viral transformations regardless of individual identity.

---

## 9. Why Myths Persist (Psychology + Platform Design)
- **Control illusion:** supplements promise agency over genetics (≈40–80% variance).  
- **Shortcut bias:** substitutes purchases for 6–12 months of work.  
- **Sunk cost:** $50–$200/month escalates commitment.  
- **Algorithmic selection:** platforms reward **visual intensity**, not accuracy; transformation content receives **3–10× engagement** versus educational posts, structurally selecting for exaggeration.

---

## 10. Minimal Efficacy Set (After Elimination)
A small set survives scrutiny.

- **Creatine monohydrate:** 5–15% power output (responders).  
- **Caffeine:** 3–11% endurance (dose/tolerance dependent).  
- **EAAs (2–3 g leucine):** acute MPS support in deficits/elderly.

Everything else offers marginal or context-dependent effects.

---

## 11. No single gatekeeper verifies biological plausibility against rate limits.
Responsibility is **distributed**, but outcomes are **real**.  
- **Manufacturers:** must prove safety, not efficacy.  
- **Influencers:** disclose affiliations, not biological plausibility.  
- **Platforms:** amplify engagement, not accuracy.  
- **Consumers:** infer oversight where none exists.

No single actor verifies whether “10 lb in 30 days” is biologically possible.

---

## 12. Regulatory Gap Analysis
Current FTC guidance mandates **disclosure of financial relationships**, not **substantiation of physiological claims**. Supplements are regulated for safety, not efficacy. Platforms face no obligation to down-rank impossible claims. This creates a regulatory void where **economic incentives dominate truth-testing**, despite predictable consumer harm.

---

## 13. Conclusions
Supplements sell explanations; **training produces outcomes**.  
Photos are not biology.  
Costs accrue over decades, not promo cycles.  
A small number of compounds help at the margins; most claims collapse under rate limits.
